Allows videos to be clicked on with a button which imports the correct data and plays the video. 

**TO RUN**

Simply open the `index.html` in any modern web browser.  Unfortunately we do not support previous versions of Internet Explorer due to modern features needed to run the app.

### Reason for Application
This project was designed for **Trevor Van Rys** for **Interactive Media Design** at **Fanshawe College**

Purpose is to demonstrate the ability to create custom controls for a video and retrieve data from an array.
